# Code for programmable logic devices used in the system

This directory contains the (currently CUPL) code for the PLDs used in the rosco_m68k. 

At the moment, this is just the address decoder (1 PLD replaces six 7400-series ICs), although more of the glue logic will probably move to PLD eventually.
